# Pentest-Reverse-Code

Here you can find a random collection of binaries from challenges, forums, ctfs meant to be reverse-engineered.

- The Program's of C, C++, Python, Assembly

  - Assembly Debuggers.

  - Buffer Overflow.

  - Malware.

  - Shell Coding.

I will try to keep this updated with new material and hopefully, I can take a look at IDA along the way too!

Feel free to reach out if you catch any errors, or in the rare case when having questions.
